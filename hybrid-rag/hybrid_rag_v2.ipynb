    "    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.\n",
    "    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.\n",
    "    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.\n",
    "    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.\n",
    "    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').\n",

    "    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent\n",

    "\n",
    "    ## Repair Strategies:\n",
    "    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations\n",
    "    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents\n",
    "    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:\n",
    "        * Add wildcards to keyword searches\n",
    "        * Expand date ranges\n",
    "        * Reduce strictness of term matches\n",
    "        * Add synonym expansion\n",

    "    - Maintain original query structure where possible\n",
    "    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting\n",
    "    - Document all modifications in revision notes\n",
    "    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations\n",
    "    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.\n",
    "    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \"DHL Express\" if that's the stored value).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:\n",
    "    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.\n",
    "      * Example: If \"delivery duration\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.\n",
    "    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.\n",
    "    - Derived Data Solutions:\n",
    "      * If exact data isn’t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.\n",

    "        1. Initial Query Analysis:\n",
    "           - Receive the user's natural language query.\n",
    "           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.\n",

    "           - {dsl_query_agent.name} generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3. Error Handling & Retry:\n",
    "           - Monitor the query execution results:\n",
    "             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.\n",

    "           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).\n",
    "           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.\n",

Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

Your tasks are:    1. Analyze failed DSL queries from the query generator    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent    4. Optimize queries for better recall when results are empty    5. Extract exact terms from 'terms' aggregations for accurate reporting.    6. Identify alternative ways to answer queries when direct fields are missing.    7. Recognize schema gaps and propose workarounds or schema modifications.    ## Repair Strategies:    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:        * Add wildcards to keyword searches        * Expand date ranges        * Reduce strictness of term matches        * Add synonym expansion    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values    ## Optimization Rules:    - Maintain original query structure where possible    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting    - Document all modifications in revision notes    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" if that's the stored value).    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.      * Example: If \\\\\\\"delivery duration\\\\\\\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.    - Derived Data Solutions:      * If exact data isn\\\\u2019t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.      * If no alternative exists, clearly state the required data and suggest schema modifications.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    -

Your tasks are:    1. Analyze failed DSL queries from the query generator    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent    4. Optimize queries for better recall when results are empty    5. Extract exact terms from 'terms' aggregations for accurate reporting.    6. Identify alternative ways to answer queries when direct fields are missing.    7. Recognize schema gaps and propose workarounds or schema modifications.    ## Repair Strategies:    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:        * Add wildcards to keyword searches        * Expand date ranges        * Reduce strictness of term matches        * Add synonym expansion    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values    ## Optimization Rules:    - Maintain original query structure where possible    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting    - Document all modifications in revision notes    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" if that's the stored value).    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.      * Example: If \\\\\\\"delivery duration\\\\\\\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.    - Derived Data Solutions:      * If exact data isn\\\\u2019t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.      * If no alternative exists, clearly state the required data and suggest schema modifications.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    -

Your tasks are:    1. Analyze failed DSL queries from the query generator    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent    4. Optimize queries for better recall when results are empty    5. Extract exact terms from 'terms' aggregations for accurate reporting.    6. Identify alternative ways to answer queries when direct fields are missing.    7. Recognize schema gaps and propose workarounds or schema modifications.    ## Repair Strategies:    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:        * Add wildcards to keyword searches        * Expand date ranges        * Reduce strictness of term matches        * Add synonym expansion    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values    ## Optimization Rules:    - Maintain original query structure where possible    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting    - Document all modifications in revision notes    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" if that's the stored value).    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.      * Example: If \\\\\\\"delivery duration\\\\\\\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.    - Derived Data Solutions:      * If exact data isn\\\\u2019t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.      * If no alternative exists, clearly state the required data and suggest schema modifications.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    -

Your tasks are:    1. Analyze failed DSL queries from the query generator    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent    4. Optimize queries for better recall when results are empty    5. Extract exact terms from 'terms' aggregations for accurate reporting.    6. Identify alternative ways to answer queries when direct fields are missing.    7. Recognize schema gaps and propose workarounds or schema modifications.    ## Repair Strategies:    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:        * Add wildcards to keyword searches        * Expand date ranges        * Reduce strictness of term matches        * Add synonym expansion    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values    ## Optimization Rules:    - Maintain original query structure where possible    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting    - Document all modifications in revision notes    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" if that's the stored value).    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.      * Example: If \\\\\\\"delivery duration\\\\\\\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.    - Derived Data Solutions:      * If exact data isn\\\\u2019t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.      * If no alternative exists, clearly state the required data and suggest schema modifications.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    -

Case sensitivity: The carrier \\\\\\\"DHL\\\\\\\" is actually stored as \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" in the database. This explains why our initial query didn't return any results.\\\\n\\\\n2.

If the DSL query returns errors or zero hits, the query is immediately routed to the Query Fixer Agent for reattempts.          - Document Content Analysis: If the query requires a synthesized, in-depth answer derived from analyzing executed query results, it is routed to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        Detailed Instructions:        Route A: Structured Data Retrieval (DSL Query Agent + Query Fixer Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

Case sensitivity: The carrier \\\\\\\"DHL\\\\\\\" is actually stored as \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" in the database. This explains why our initial query didn't return any results.2. Shipping cost: There are shipments with costs in various ranges, including some over $10.3. Query relaxation: By removing filters, we were able to see the full distribution of carriers and shipping costs.To find DHL shipments with shipping costs over $10, you should use the following optimized query:```json{  \\\\\\\"query\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"bool\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"must\\\\\\\": [        {          \\\\\\\"match_phrase\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"delivery.carrier\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\"          }        },        {          \\\\\\\"range\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"delivery.shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {              \\\\\\\"gt\\\\\\\": 10            }          }        }      ]    }  }}```This query should return the desired results. The key changes are:1. Using \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" instead of just \\\\\\\"DHL\\\\\\\"2. Using a match_phrase query for exact matching of the carrier name3. Keeping the original shipping cost filterIf you need to broaden the search in the future, consider using a prefix query (e.g., \\\\\\\"DHL*\\\\\\\") or lowering the shipping cost threshold.}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"user\\\"}]}\",\n",

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

If the DSL query returns errors or zero hits, the query is immediately routed to the Query Fixer Agent for reattempts.          - Document Content Analysis: If the query requires a synthesized, in-depth answer derived from analyzing executed query results, it is routed to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        Detailed Instructions:        Route A: Structured Data Retrieval (DSL Query Agent + Query Fixer Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

Unless stated, the average order value measured does NOT include taxes and shipping. Shipping spend represents the total dollar amount merchants spent on shipping as a percentage of overall revenue. Both metrics can be used a measurement tool to see how your own AOV and shipping spend compare to those selling in the same product category as you.\\n| Industry (Category) | Average Order Value (Cart Value) | Average Order Value (Shipping + Taxes Included) |\\n|-|-|-|\\n| | | |\\n| All Collective | $82.47 | $123.80 |\\n| Apparel | $96.36 | $103.11 |\\n| Beauty/Skincare | $73.79 | $80.45 |\\n| Electronics | $146.05 | $157.88 |\\n| Health/Wellness | $77.75 | $83.98 |\\n| Jewelry | $89.08 | $94.71 |\\n| Sports & Outdoor | $132.91 | $142.73 |\\n| Industry (Category) | Average Spent (On Shipping) | Percent Spent (On Shipping) |\\n|-|-|-|\\n| | | |\\n| All Collective | $10.37 | 8,37% |\\n| Apparel | $8.29 | 8.03% |\\n| Beauty/Skincare | $10.39 | 12.91% |\\n| Electronics | $15.90 | 10,07% |\\n| Health/Wellness | $9.29 | 11.06% |\\n| Jewelry | $7.66 | 8.08% |\\n| Sports & Outdoor | $13.97 | 9.78% |\\nAOV across industries + $4.38 AOV across industries rose from $78.09 to $82.47 since 2021\\nBeauty/Skincare spends <$12.91% Beauty/Skincare spends the largest percent on shipping compared to their order value\\nAverage spent on shipping 8,37% Across all major e-commerce markets\\nElect $1 Electronics h among e-co\\n06\\n\\n    </content>\\n    <source>\\n        1\\n    </source>\\n</search_result>\\n<search_result>\\n    <content>\\n        # 2022 E-commerce & Shipping Benchmarks Report\\n# The Prolonged Effects of Covid-19 On E-commerce\\nEven with the introduction of the Covid-19 vaccine to the public in April 2021, the effects of the virus were still felt throughout the year. Adoption of the vaccine was slower than expected and hesitation to shop in physical retail stores held true for much of the year. Supply chain issues caused by the upheavals in 2020 were also still in full effect - but this didn't stop consumers from ordering online. This is especially highlighted when comparing AOV from 2020 and 2021.\\n| Industry | 2020 AOV* | 2020 Average Shipping Spend | 2021 AOV* | 2021 Average Shipping Spend |\\n|-|-|-|-|-|\\n| | | | | |\\n| All Collective | $71.10 | $9.43 | $82.47 | $10.37 |\\n| Apparel | $81.94 | $8.20 | $96.36 | $8.29 |\\n| Beauty/Skincare | $56.29 | $8.77 | $73.79 | $10.39 |\\n| Electronics | $122.98 | $11.79 | $146.05 | $15.90 |\\n| Health/Wellness | $79.87 | $8.37 | $77.75 | $9.29 |\\n| Jewelry | $89.94 | $8.35 | $89.08 | $7.66 |\\n| Sports & Outdoor | $102.72 | $10.55 | $132.91 | $13.97 |\\n*AOV does not include shipping and taxes.\\n<figure>\\n<figure_type>ICON</figure_type>\\nTitle: 7% Increase in AOV\\nThe image shows a 7% increase in Average Order Value (AOV) year over year, indicating that consumers have continued their increased online shopping habits from 2020 into 2021.\\n</figure>\\nWith much of the world under lockdown in 2020, consumers turned to online shopping as a means to handle more of their buying needs. That habit carried over into 2021, as highlighted by the increase of AOV year over year (YoY).\\nincrease in consumer prices for all items from December 2020 to December 2021\\nAnother area of the economy that may have affected this change in AOV could be the rise in inflation. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, consumer prices for all items rose 7% from December 2020 to December 2021. However, the collective change in AOV for merchants year-over-year was about a 16% increase. While inflation certainly had an effect, it wasn't the only reason for the increase in spending amount.\\n<figure>\\n<figure_type>ICON</figure_type>\\nTitle: Increase in Average Order Value for Merchants\\nThe image shows a 16% increase in the average order value (AOV) for merchants year-over-year. This increase in AOV is discussed in the context of rising inflation, which had an effect but was not the only reason for the increase in spending amount.\\n</figure>\\nincrease in Average Order Value for merchants year- over-year\\nTo go along with this, average shipping spend also increased. More people shopping online meant more packages that needed to be delivered, which put a strain on an already hampered global supply chain. Peak surcharges, fuel surcharges, and general price increases were set by all major carriers to keep up with consumer demand despite these supply chain issues. This may have aided in this increased shipping spend YoY.\\nwww.goshippo.com | sales@goshippo.com www.wix.com\\n## Key Figures For International Shipping\\nOne of the biggest advantages of e-commerce is the ability to buy and sell from all over the world. Shipping internationally opens your business up to reach customers you may have never thought possible. Many online merchants based in the US are finding this to be the case as highlighted by the percentage of them in each category that are shipping to customers outside the country.\\n## Percentage of U.S. Based Online Sellers Shipping Internationally\\nApparel\\t39.26%\\nBeauty/Skincare\\t37.19%\\nElectronics\\t61.07%\\nHealth/Wellness\\t34.44%\\nJewelry\\t46,22%\\nSports & Outdoor\\t52,84%\\n## Percentage of Non-U.S. Based Merchants Shipping Internationally\\n<figure>\\n<figure_type>ICON</figure_type>\\nTitle: Percentage of Non-U.S. Based Merchants Shipping Internationally\\nThe image shows the text \\\"vs\\\" in a purple circle, indicating a comparison between two sets of data.

Several factors come into play that could explain this disparity. The first is that the U.S. by size and population is one of the largest in the world, limiting the need to ship overseas. The second is that international shipping adds a layer of complexity to your e-commerce business that may not be needed depending on what your selling. However, in order to maximize the potential of your e-commerce business, selling internationally should be a key consideration.\\n14\\n15\\n\\n    </content>\\n    <source>\\n        2\\n    </source>\\n</search_result>\\n<search_result>\\n    <content>\\n        # 22 E-commerce & Shipping Benchmarks Report\\n## Top 10 Zip Codes Getting The Most Packages Delivered\\nAs expected, e-commerce merchants can be found scattered across the country.

This past year was no different with Autumn taking the cake as the peak season for e-commerce sales.\\n| Quarter | Order Value Across All Segments* |\\n|-|-|\\n| April 1, 2021 - June 30, 2021 | $428,435,884.18 |\\n| July 1, 2021 - September 30, 2021 | $428,217,019.56 |\\n| October 1, 2021 - December 31, 2021 | $500,185,981.21 |\\n| January 1, 2022 - March 31, 2021 | $404,617,159.45 |\\n*Order Value does not include include taxes and shipping spend. Segments include that of Apparel, Beauty/ Skincare, Electronics, Health/wellness, Jewelry, and Sports & Outdoors. Order value does not reflect total sales of all merchants in this category.\\nAlong with how much consumers are spending on e-commerce each season, the number of packages delivered also shifts as the seasons go along. The amount of packages delivered also varies by segment.\\n| Quarter | Total Percent Increase in Packages Delivered (QoQ) Across Segments |\\n|-|-|\\n| | |\\n| April 1, 2021 June 30, 2021 | 17.93% |\\n| July 1, 2021 September 30, 2021 | 14.96% |\\n| October 1, 2021 - December 31, 2021 | 11.98% |\\n| January 1, 2022 March 31, 2021 | 6.90% |\\nwww.goshippo.com | sales@goshippo.com I www.wix.com\\nHighest Order Value of 2021\\n$500,185,981.21\\nOctober 1, 2021 December 31, 2021\\nWhen looking at this breakdown you can see that while the holiday season (October-December) brought in the highest order value of the year, it did not translate to the most packages. This could be because consumers during that time often buy pricier items such as TVs, game consoles, and other large ticket items, leaving less disposable income on smaller items.\\nHighest Number Of Packages In 2021\\n17.93%\\nApril 1, 2021 June 30, 2021\\nIn comparison, the quarter with the highest number of packages delivered (April-June) did not have one of the highest order values.\\nLowest Order Value in 2021\\n$404,617,159.45\\nJanuary 1, 2022 March 31, 2021\\n## Lowest Increase in Packages Delivered\\n6.90%\\nJanuary 1, 2022 March 31, 2021\\nWhen looking at both tables you'll find that January through March saw the lowest order value and the lowest percentage increase of packages delivered. The beginning portion of every year is known in the industry as \\\"returns season.\\\" This time period usually consists of customers returning unwanted holiday gifts. This may explain the lower percentage of increase for both segments.\\nHighest Increase in Packages Delivered\\n51.73% Beauty/Skincare\\n41.19% Health/wellness\\nWhen digging into the numbers further we found Beauty/Skincare and Health/wellness had the highest percentage change of packages delivered at 51.73% and 41.19% respectively. This could be due to the products themselves being smaller and more affordable, resulting in more sales and more packages required.\\nDELIVERY\\n\\n    </content>\\n    <source>\\n        4\\n    </source>\\n</search_result>\\n\\n</search_results>\\nIf you reference information from a search result within your answer, you must include a citation to source where the information was found.

If the DSL query returns errors or zero hits, the query is immediately routed to the Query Fixer Agent for reattempts.          - Document Content Analysis: If the query requires a synthesized, in-depth answer derived from analyzing executed query results, it is routed to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        Detailed Instructions:        Route A: Structured Data Retrieval (DSL Query Agent + Query Fixer Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

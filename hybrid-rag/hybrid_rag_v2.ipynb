    "    ## Query Construction Rules:\n",
    "    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.\n",
    "    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.\n",
    "    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.\n",
    "    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.\n",
    "    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').\n",
    "    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.\n",

    "    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent\n",

    "    ## Repair Strategies:\n",
    "    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations\n",
    "    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents\n",
    "    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:\n",

    "        * Expand date ranges\n",
    "        * Reduce strictness of term matches\n",

    "    - Maintain original query structure where possible\n",
    "    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting\n",
    "    - Document all modifications in revision notes\n",
    "    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations\n",
    "    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.\n",
    "    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \"DHL Express\" if that's the stored value).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:\n",
    "    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.\n",
    "      * Example: If \"delivery duration\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.\n",
    "    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.\n",
    "    - Derived Data Solutions:\n",
    "      * If exact data isn’t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.\n",

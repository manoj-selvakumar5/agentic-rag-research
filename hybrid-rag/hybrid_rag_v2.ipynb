    "    given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Instructions:\n",
    "    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.\n",
    "    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.\n",
    "    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Query Construction Rules:\n",
    "    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.\n",
    "    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.\n",
    "    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.\n",
    "    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.\n",
    "    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').\n",
    "    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.\n",
    "    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.\n",

    "    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages\n",
    "    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent\n",

    "\n",
    "    ## Repair Strategies:\n",
    "    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations\n",
    "    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents\n",
    "    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:\n",
    "        * Add wildcards to keyword searches\n",
    "        * Expand date ranges\n",
    "        * Reduce strictness of term matches\n",
    "        * Add synonym expansion\n",
    "    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values\n",

    "    ## Optimization Rules:\n",
    "    - Maintain original query structure where possible\n",
    "    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting\n",
    "    - Document all modifications in revision notes\n",
    "    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations\n",
    "    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.\n",
    "    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \"DHL Express\" if that's the stored value).\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:\n",
    "    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.\n",
    "      * Example: If \"delivery duration\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.\n",
    "    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.\n",
    "    - Derived Data Solutions:\n",
    "      * If exact data isn’t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.\n",

If the DSL query returns errors or zero hits, the query is immediately routed to the Query Fixer Agent for reattempts.          - Document Content Analysis: If the query requires a synthesized, in-depth answer derived from analyzing executed query results, it is routed to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        Detailed Instructions:        Route A: Structured Data Retrieval (DSL Query Agent + Query Fixer Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

Your tasks are:    1. Analyze failed DSL queries from the query generator    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent    4. Optimize queries for better recall when results are empty    5. Extract exact terms from 'terms' aggregations for accurate reporting.    6. Identify alternative ways to answer queries when direct fields are missing.    7. Recognize schema gaps and propose workarounds or schema modifications.    ## Repair Strategies:    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:        * Add wildcards to keyword searches        * Expand date ranges        * Reduce strictness of term matches        * Add synonym expansion    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values    ## Optimization Rules:    - Maintain original query structure where possible    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting    - Document all modifications in revision notes    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" if that's the stored value).    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.      * Example: If \\\\\\\"delivery duration\\\\\\\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.    - Derived Data Solutions:      * If exact data isn\\\\u2019t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.      * If no alternative exists, clearly state the required data and suggest schema modifications.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    -

Your tasks are:    1. Analyze failed DSL queries from the query generator    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent    4. Optimize queries for better recall when results are empty    5. Extract exact terms from 'terms' aggregations for accurate reporting.    6. Identify alternative ways to answer queries when direct fields are missing.    7. Recognize schema gaps and propose workarounds or schema modifications.    ## Repair Strategies:    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:        * Add wildcards to keyword searches        * Expand date ranges        * Reduce strictness of term matches        * Add synonym expansion    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values    ## Optimization Rules:    - Maintain original query structure where possible    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting    - Document all modifications in revision notes    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" if that's the stored value).    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.      * Example: If \\\\\\\"delivery duration\\\\\\\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.    - Derived Data Solutions:      * If exact data isn\\\\u2019t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.      * If no alternative exists, clearly state the required data and suggest schema modifications.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    -

Your tasks are:    1. Analyze failed DSL queries from the query generator    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent    4. Optimize queries for better recall when results are empty    5. Extract exact terms from 'terms' aggregations for accurate reporting.    6. Identify alternative ways to answer queries when direct fields are missing.    7. Recognize schema gaps and propose workarounds or schema modifications.    ## Repair Strategies:    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:        * Add wildcards to keyword searches        * Expand date ranges        * Reduce strictness of term matches        * Add synonym expansion    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values    ## Optimization Rules:    - Maintain original query structure where possible    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting    - Document all modifications in revision notes    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" if that's the stored value).    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.      * Example: If \\\\\\\"delivery duration\\\\\\\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.    - Derived Data Solutions:      * If exact data isn\\\\u2019t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.      * If no alternative exists, clearly state the required data and suggest schema modifications.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    -

Your tasks are:    1. Analyze failed DSL queries from the query generator    2. Diagnose errors using OpenSearch error messages    3. Apply targeted fixes while maintaining original intent    4. Optimize queries for better recall when results are empty    5. Extract exact terms from 'terms' aggregations for accurate reporting.    6. Identify alternative ways to answer queries when direct fields are missing.    7. Recognize schema gaps and propose workarounds or schema modifications.    ## Repair Strategies:    - SYNTAX ERRORS: Fix formatting issues in nested queries/aggregations    - FIELD ERRORS: Map invalid fields to valid schema equivalents    - ZERO HITS: Apply query relaxation techniques:        * Add wildcards to keyword searches        * Expand date ranges        * Reduce strictness of term matches        * Add synonym expansion    - Ensure queries include 'terms' aggregations to capture exact values    ## Optimization Rules:    - Maintain original query structure where possible    - Prefer query-time fixes over rearchitecting    - Document all modifications in revision notes    - Limit query relaxation to 3 iterations    - When results are found, check the 'terms' aggregation for the exact field values.    - Report the exact terms from the data (e.g., use \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" if that's the stored value).    ## Schema Gap Analysis & Alternative Solutions:    - Creative Field Mapping: If direct fields are missing, use existing fields to infer answers.      * Example: If \\\\\\\"delivery duration\\\\\\\" is not available, compute it using `delivered_time - out_for_delivery_time`.    - Schema Enhancement: Identify missing fields required for full query support.    - Derived Data Solutions:      * If exact data isn\\\\u2019t available but can be computed, create scripted fields using painless scripting.      * If no alternative exists, clearly state the required data and suggest schema modifications.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    -

Case sensitivity: The carrier \\\\\\\"DHL\\\\\\\" is actually stored as \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" in the database. This explains why our initial query didn't return any results.\\\\n\\\\n2.

If the DSL query returns errors or zero hits, the query is immediately routed to the Query Fixer Agent for reattempts.          - Document Content Analysis: If the query requires a synthesized, in-depth answer derived from analyzing executed query results, it is routed to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        Detailed Instructions:        Route A: Structured Data Retrieval (DSL Query Agent + Query Fixer Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

Case sensitivity: The carrier \\\\\\\"DHL\\\\\\\" is actually stored as \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" in the database. This explains why our initial query didn't return any results.2. Shipping cost: There are shipments with costs in various ranges, including some over $10.3. Query relaxation: By removing filters, we were able to see the full distribution of carriers and shipping costs.To find DHL shipments with shipping costs over $10, you should use the following optimized query:```json{  \\\\\\\"query\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"bool\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"must\\\\\\\": [        {          \\\\\\\"match_phrase\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"delivery.carrier\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\"          }        },        {          \\\\\\\"range\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"delivery.shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {              \\\\\\\"gt\\\\\\\": 10            }          }        }      ]    }  }}```This query should return the desired results. The key changes are:1. Using \\\\\\\"DHL Express\\\\\\\" instead of just \\\\\\\"DHL\\\\\\\"2. Using a match_phrase query for exact matching of the carrier name3. Keeping the original shipping cost filterIf you need to broaden the search in the future, consider using a prefix query (e.g., \\\\\\\"DHL*\\\\\\\") or lowering the shipping cost threshold.}]\\\",\\\"role\\\":\\\"user\\\"}]}\",\n",

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Your task is to convert a     given natural language user question into a well-structured Query DSL.    ## Instructions:    - Use the provided e-commerce shipping schema to construct the query.    - Encapsulate the output in <json>...</json> tags.    - Follow the syntax of the Query DSL strictly; do not introduce elements outside the provided schema.    ## Query Construction Rules:    - **Keyword fields** (carrier, status, country): Use `term` for exact matches or `prefix`/`wildcard` for partial matches.    - **Text fields** (description, address): Use `match` queries to account for analyzed terms.    - **Nested fields** (tracking): Always use `nested` queries.    - **Date fields**: Use `range` queries with date math for filtering by date ranges.    - **Aggregations**: When counting occurrences, use a 'terms' aggregation on the relevant keyword field to capture the exact values present (e.g., 'delivery.carrier').    - Break down complex queries into smaller parts for accuracy.    - Think step-by-step before constructing the query.    ## Schema:    {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}    ## Output Format:    - Return only the generated Query DSL within <json>...</json> tags.    - Do not include explanations, comments, or additional text.You have been provided with a set of functions to answer the user's question.You will ALWAYS follow the below guidelines when you are answering a question:<guidelines>- Think through the user's question, extract all data from the question and the previous conversations before creating a plan.- ALWAYS optimize the plan by using multiple function calls at the same time whenever possible.- Never assume any parameter values while invoking a function.- Provide your final answer to the user's question within <answer></answer> xml tags and ALWAYS keep it concise.- Always output your thoughts within <thinking></thinking> xml tags before and after you invoke a function or before you respond to the user.- NEVER disclose any information about the tools and functions that are available to you.

Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires structured data retrieval from the e-commerce shipping data.           - Validate the query against the provided schema:             {  \\\\\\\"shipping\\\\\\\": {    \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {      \\\\\\\"order_id\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"tracking_number\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"created_at\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"      },      \\\\\\\"sender\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"recipient\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"name\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"email\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"city\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"country\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"package\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"weight\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"description\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"text\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"value\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"delivery\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"carrier\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"estimated_date\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"shipping_cost\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"float\\\\\\\"          }        }      },      \\\\\\\"tracking\\\\\\\": {        \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"nested\\\\\\\",        \\\\\\\"properties\\\\\\\": {          \\\\\\\"timestamp\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"date\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"status\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          },          \\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": {            \\\\\\\"type\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"keyword\\\\\\\"          }        }      }    }  }}           - If the query qualifies, route it to dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. DSL Query Execution:           - dsl-query-agent-us-west-2-533 generates a Query DSL that is encapsulated in <json>...</json> tags and follows the provided schema.        3. Error Handling & Retry:           - Monitor the query execution results:             a. If the DSL query returns syntax or validation errors, or if the result is zero hits, capture the error context.             b. Immediately route the query, along with diagnostic details, to query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533.             c. query-fixer-agent-us-west-2-533 applies targeted fixes and query relaxation techniques, then returns a modified DSL query.             d. Validate the modified query; allow up to 3 retry attempts if necessary.        4. Evaluation & Final Approval (for structured data queries):           - Confirm that the final DSL query adheres to best practices (for example, proper nested queries, correct field types and mappings).           - Maintain an audit trail of all query versions and modifications.           - Generate an execution summary including:             - Query versions attempted.             - Reasons for modifications.             - Performance metrics.        General Aggregation Guidance:           - If an aggregation returns an unexpectedly inflated count, verify whether the aggregation is counting nested or repeated values.           - To accurately count unique items, use a cardinality aggregation on a unique field identifier rather than aggregating on fields that might contain duplicate entries.        Route B: Document Content Analysis (KB Response Agent)        1. Initial Query Analysis:           - Receive the user's natural language query.           - Determine if the query requires synthesizing and analyzing document content from executed queries.           - If so, route the query to kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533.        2. KB Response Generation:           - kb-response-agent-us-west-2-533 synthesizes and validates the information from the provided passages.           - Generate a final response that includes:             a. A direct answer.             b. Supporting evidence with relevant quotes and citations.             c. A confidence level.        3.

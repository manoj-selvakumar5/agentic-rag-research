The table is organized by asset class and includes the cost, accumulated depreciation, and net book value of each class.     Land is recorded at its original cost, with no accumulated depreciation, as it is not subject to depreciation. The buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, and vehicles are subject to depreciation over their useful lives. The accumulated depreciation represents the total amount of depreciation expense that has been recognized on these assets since they were acquired. The net book value of each asset class is calculated as the cost less the accumulated depreciation.     The total property and equipment, net, as of December 31, 2022, is $307,500,000, which represents a significant investment in the long-lived assets that Octank Financial uses in its operations.\",\n",
